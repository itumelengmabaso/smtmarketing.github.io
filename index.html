    <p>South Africa is currently facing a problem of unemployment which keeps on rising on an alarming rate, faces the inability of industries that also fail to create jobs and mostly for the upcoming generation/youth. The government has by far tried to

      newly developed companies.<br><br>The South African economy and Africa as a whole will only be successful if the majority race that is poor is empowered and given the stage and the opportunity to participate in the economy and to be given their
      equal roles in the economies activities. In this case the company will ensure that black owned companies get the exposure they need to grow their business and also increase their capital and communicate better with their potential customers. The
